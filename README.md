Note: The dataset is organized into two folders (O and R) under both train and val.

2. Prerequisites
Python 3.11+

pip (Python package manager)

(Optional, for development) Git and a GitHub account

3. Installation
Clone this repository


bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-waste-classification.git
cd ai-waste-classification
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)


bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate  # on macOS / Linux
Install dependencies


bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Dataset Setup
The model expects a folder called data with the following structure:


text
data/
├── train/
│   ├── O/    # Organic training images
│   └── R/    # Recyclable training images
└── val/
    ├── O/    # Organic validation images
    └── R/    # Recyclable validation images
O contains images of organic waste (food scraps, fruits, vegetables, etc.).

R contains images of recyclable waste (plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc.).

Steps:

Create the folders as shown above.

Place your training images into data/train/O and data/train/R.

Place your validation images into data/val/O and data/val/R.

The class names are taken automatically from these folder names (O and R).

5. Training the Model
If you want to train the model from scratch or retrain it, use train_model.py.

Make sure your dataset is prepared under data/train and data/val.

Run:


bash
python train_model.py
What train_model.py does (high level):

Loads images from data/train and data/val using Keras image datasets.

Uses MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor with transfer learning.

Adds a classification head for 2 classes (O, R).

Trains for a configurable number of epochs.

Saves the trained model as:


text
ai_waste_classification_model.keras
If a file with the same name already exists, it will be overwritten with the new trained model.

6. Running the Web App Locally
The Streamlit app (app.py) loads the saved model and provides a simple user interface.

Ensure that ai_waste_classification_model.keras exists in the project root (either pre‑trained or generated by running train_model.py).

Start the app:


bash
streamlit run app.py
A browser window will open (or go to the URL shown in the terminal, typically http://localhost:8501).

Usage inside the app:

Click “Browse files” or drag‑and‑drop an image.

Press “Classify”.

The app displays:

Predicted class: “Organic waste” or “Recyclable waste”

Model confidence (percentage)

Suggested bin: “Wet / Organic bin” or “Dry / Recyclables bin”

7. Code Overview
train_model.py (summary)
Defines image size and batch size.

Loads datasets from data/train and data/val.

Applies data augmentation (random flips, rotations, zoom).

Builds a model:

Base: MobileNetV2 with ImageNet weights (frozen initially).

Global average pooling.

Dropout.

Dense layer with 2 outputs (softmax).

Compiles with Adam optimizer and sparse_categorical_crossentropy.

Trains for a set number of epochs.

Saves the whole model to ai_waste_classification_model.keras.

app.py (summary)
Loads ai_waste_classification_model.keras.

Uses the same preprocessing as in training (resize to 224×224, MobileNet
