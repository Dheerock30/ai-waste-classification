# AI Waste Classification (Organic vs Recyclable)

This project is a simple AI prototype that classifies waste images into two classes:

- **O** – Organic waste  
- **R** – Recyclable waste  

The model is trained in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and served as a web app using Streamlit. Users can upload a photo of waste and get a predicted class plus a suggested bin.

> The dataset is organized into two folders (`O` and `R`) under both `train` and `val`.

## 2. Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer  
- `pip` (Python package manager)  
- (Optional) Git and a GitHub account, if you want to contribute or deploy

---

## 3. Installation

1. **Clone this repository**

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-waste-classification.git
cd ai-waste-classification


2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**

python -m venv .venv

Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate


3. **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 4. Dataset Setup

The model expects a folder called `data` with the following structure:

data/
├── train/
│ ├── O/ # Organic training images
│ └── R/ # Recyclable training images
└── val/
├── O/ # Organic validation images
└── R/ # Recyclable validation images


- `O` contains images of **organic waste** (food scraps, fruits, vegetables, etc.).  
- `R` contains images of **recyclable waste** (plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc.).

Steps:

1. Create the folders exactly as shown above.  
2. Place training images into `data/train/O` and `data/train/R`.  
3. Place validation images into `data/val/O` and `data/val/R`.  
4. The class names are taken automatically from these folder names (`O` and `R`).

## 5. Training the Model

If you want to train or retrain the model, use `train_model.py`.

1. Ensure your dataset is prepared under `data/train` and `data/val`.  
2. Run:

python train_model.py


What `train_model.py` does:

- Loads images from `data/train` and `data/val`.  
- Applies basic data augmentation (random flip, rotation, zoom).  
- Uses **MobileNetV2** as a base model (transfer learning from ImageNet).  
- Adds a small classification head for 2 classes (`O`, `R`).  
- Trains for a configured number of epochs.  
- Saves the trained model as:

ai_waste_classification_model.keras


If the file already exists, it will be overwritten with the new trained model.

You can adjust training settings (e.g., number of epochs) inside `train_model.py`.

## 6. Running the Web App Locally

The Streamlit app (`app.py`) loads the saved model and provides a browser interface.

1. Make sure `ai_waste_classification_model.keras` is present in the project root (generated by `train_model.py` or downloaded).  
2. Start the app:

streamlit run app.py


3. Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:8501`) if it does not open automatically.

4. Inside the app:

- Upload an image of waste (JPG/PNG).  
- Click **“Classify”**.  
- The app displays:
  - Predicted class: **“Organic waste”** or **“Recyclable waste”**  
  - Model confidence (percentage)  
  - Suggested bin: **“Wet / Organic bin”** or **“Dry / Recyclables bin”**

## 7. Code Overview

### `train_model.py`

High‑level steps:

- Define image size and batch size.  
- Load training and validation datasets from `data/`.  
- Apply data augmentation.  
- Build a model:

- Base: `MobileNetV2` with ImageNet weights (frozen initially).  
- Global average pooling layer.  
- Dropout layer.  
- Dense layer with 2 outputs and softmax activation.

- Compile with Adam optimizer and `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss.  
- Train for several epochs.  
- Save the model to
