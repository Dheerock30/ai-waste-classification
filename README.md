# AI Waste Classification (Organic vs Recyclable)

This project is a simple AI prototype that classifies waste images into two classes:

- **O** – Organic waste  
- **R** – Recyclable waste  

The model is trained in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and served as a web app using Streamlit. Users can upload a photo of waste and get a predicted class plus a suggested bin.

## 1. Project Structure

```text

├── app.py                           # Streamlit web app
├── train_model.py                   # Training script
├── ai_waste_classification_model.keras  # Saved Keras model
├── requirements.txt                 # Python dependencies
└── data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── O/                       # Organic training images
    │   └── R/                       # Recyclable training images
    └── val/
        ├── O/                       # Organic validation images
        └── R/                       # Recyclable validation images
The dataset is organized into two folders (O and R) under both train and val.

2. Prerequisites
Python 3.11 or newer

pip (Python package manager)

(Optional) Git and a GitHub account, if you want to contribute or deploy

3. Installation
Clone this repository


bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-waste-classification.git
cd ai-waste-classification
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)


bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
# source .venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies


bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Dataset Setup
The model expects a folder called data with the following structure:


text
data/
├── train/
│   ├── O/    # Organic training images
│   └── R/    # Recyclable training images
└── val/
    ├── O/    # Organic validation images
    └── R/    # Recyclable validation images
O contains images of organic waste (food scraps, fruits, vegetables, etc.).

R contains images of recyclable waste (plastic, metal, glass, paper, etc.).

Steps:

Create the folders exactly as shown above.

Place training images into data/train/O and data/train/R.

Place validation images into data/val/O and data/val/R.

The class names are taken automatically from these folder names (O and R).

5. Training the Model
If you want to train or retrain the model, use train_model.py.

Ensure your dataset is prepared under data/train and data/val.

Run:


bash
python train_model.py
What train_model.py does:

Loads images from data/train and data/val.

Applies basic data augmentation (random flip, rotation, zoom).

Uses MobileNetV2 as a base model (transfer learning from ImageNet).

Adds a small classification head for 2 classes (O, R).

Trains for a configured number of epochs.

Saves the trained model as:


text
ai_waste_classification_model.keras
If the file already exists, it will be overwritten with the new trained model.

You can adjust training settings (for example, number of epochs) inside train_model.py.

6. Running the Web App Locally
The Streamlit app (app.py) loads the saved model and provides a browser interface.

Make sure ai_waste_classification_model.keras is present in the project root (generated by train_model.py or downloaded).

Start the app:


bash
streamlit run app.py
Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501) if it does not open automatically.

Inside the app:

Upload an image of waste (JPG/PNG).

Click “Classify”.

The app displays:

Predicted class: “Organic waste” or “Recyclable waste”

Model confidence (percentage)

Suggested bin: “Wet / Organic bin” or “Dry / Recyclables bin”

7. Code Overview
train_model.py
High‑level steps:

Define image size and batch size.

Load training and validation datasets from data/ using image_dataset_from_directory.

Apply data augmentation to reduce overfitting.
